HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) forms the backbone of web development, providing the structure and content for web pages. 

## Purpose of HTML

HTML serves as the standard language for creating web pages. Its primary purpose is to define the structure and content of a webpage, allowing browsers to interpret and display the information to users. Basically it just adds the content of the website on their.

## Key Concepts

- **Elements:** Fundamental building blocks of HTML, structured by tags.
- **Tags:** Enclosed in angle brackets (`<tag>`), defining different parts of content.
- **Attributes:** Additional information added to tags, affecting their behavior or appearance.

## Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document follows a specific structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- Content goes here -->

</body>
</html>
```

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`:** Declaration specifying the HTML version used.
- **`<html>`:** Root element encapsulating the entire document.
- **`<head>`:** Contains meta-information and external resources.
- **`<title>`:** Sets the title displayed in the browser's title bar.
- **`<body>`:** Contains the visible content of the webpage.

## Elements and Tags

HTML uses tags to define elements within a document:

```html
<!-- Heading -->
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>

<!-- Paragraph -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Image -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">

<!-- Link -->
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit our site</a>
```

- **`<h1>` to `<h6>`:** Heading tags for different levels of headings.
- **`<p>`:** Paragraph tag for text paragraphs.
- **`<img>`:** Image tag to embed images with `src` (source) and `alt` (alternate text) attributes.
- **`<a>`:** Anchor tag for hyperlinks, using `href` attribute for the URL.

Understanding these foundational aspects of HTML provides a strong base for learning more advanced concepts and techniques in web development.
