## Introduction
Links are essential in HTML for navigating between different web pages and resources. Anchor tags (`<a>`) are used to create links in HTML documents.

## Basic Link Structure
```html
<a href="URL">Link Text</a>
```
- `href`: Specifies the URL of the linked resource.
- Link Text: Text displayed as the clickable link.

## Absolute and Relative URLs
- **Absolute URL**: Contains the complete web address, including the protocol (`http://` or `https://`) and domain name.
- **Relative URL**: Specifies the path to the linked resource relative to the current document's location.

### Example
```html
<!-- Absolute URL -->
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

<!-- Relative URL -->
<a href="about.html">About Us</a>
```

## Linking to Sections within a Page
- You can create links to specific sections within the same page using the `id` attribute.

### Example
```html
<!-- Link to a section with id "section1" -->
<a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>

<!-- Section to be linked -->
<section id="section1">
    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <!-- Content -->
</section>
```

## Linking to Email Addresses
- You can create links to email addresses using the `mailto:` scheme.

### Example
```html
<a href="mailto:info@example.com">Contact Us</a>
```

## Link Target Attribute
- The `target` attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

### Values:
- `_self`: Opens the linked document in the same frame or window.
- `_blank`: Opens the linked document in a new window or tab.

### Example
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Open in New Tab</a>
```

## Link Title Attribute
- The `title` attribute provides additional information about the link, which is displayed as a tooltip when hovering over the link.

### Example
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" title="Visit Example">Example Website</a>
```

## Conclusion
HTML anchor tags (`<a>`) are used to create links, allowing users to navigate between web pages and resources. By understanding the basic structure of links and their attributes, you can create effective navigation systems and enhance the user experience on your website.
