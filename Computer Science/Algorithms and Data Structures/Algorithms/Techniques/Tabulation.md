**Summary:**
Tabulation is a dynamic programming technique used to solve problems by building a table and filling it with solutions to subproblems. It involves iterating through the problem space in a bottom-up manner, computing and storing the solutions to smaller subproblems, and gradually building up to the final solution. Tabulation is best suited for problems with optimal substructure, where the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.

**Algorithm:**

1. Define a table data structure to store the solutions to subproblems.
2. Initialize the table with base cases or initial values.
3. Iterate through the problem space in a bottom-up manner, filling the table with solutions to subproblems.
4. Use the solutions stored in the table to compute the final solution to the original problem.

**Example (Java):**

```java
public class TabulationExample {
    public static int fib(int n) {
        if (n <= 1)
            return n;

        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];

        return dp[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        System.out.println("Fibonacci number at index " + n + ": " + fib(n));
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the size of the problem space.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the size of the table.

**Advantages:**
1. Efficient solution for problems with optimal substructure.
2. Guarantees an optimal solution by systematically exploring the problem space.
3. Avoids redundant computations by storing solutions to subproblems in a table.
4. Performs well for problems with a relatively small problem space.

**Disadvantages:**
1. Requires additional space to store the table of solutions.
2. May not be suitable for problems with a large problem space or non-optimal substructure.
3. Requires careful consideration of the problem space and table dimensions.

**Applications:**
1. Solving problems with overlapping subproblems, such as Fibonacci sequence or binomial coefficients.
2. Finding optimal solutions to problems involving sequences, arrays, or graphs.
3. Optimization problems, such as finding the shortest path or maximizing profits, by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.
