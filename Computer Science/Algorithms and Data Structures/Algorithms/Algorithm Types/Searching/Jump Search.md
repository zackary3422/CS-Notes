**Summary:**
Jump Search is a searching algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. It combines the efficiency of binary search with the simplicity of linear search. Jump Search is particularly useful for large arrays where binary search may have high overhead, and the array elements are uniformly distributed.

**Algorithm:**

1. Define the block size \( \text{jumpSize} \).
2. Start from the first element and jump forward by \( \text{jumpSize} \) steps until finding a value greater than or equal to the target value.
3. Perform a linear search within the block, starting from the previous block's index and ending at the current index.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the target value is found or the end of the array is reached.

**Code (Java):**

```java
public class JumpSearch {
    public static int jumpSearch(int[] arr, int x) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int jumpSize = (int) Math.sqrt(n);
        int step = jumpSize;
        int prev = 0;

        // Jumping forward until finding a block containing the target value
        while (arr[Math.min(step, n) - 1] < x) {
            prev = step;
            step += jumpSize;
            if (prev >= n)
                return -1; // Element not found
        }

        // Performing linear search within the block
        while (arr[prev] < x) {
            prev++;
            if (prev == Math.min(step, n))
                return -1; // Element not found
        }

        // If the element is found, return its index
        if (arr[prev] == x)
            return prev;

        return -1; // Element not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
        int x = 6;
        int index = jumpSearch(arr, x);
        if (index != -1)
            System.out.println("Element found at index " + index);
        else
            System.out.println("Element not found");
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(âˆšn), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1).

**Advantages:**
1. Efficient for large arrays with uniform distribution.
2. Combines the efficiency of binary search with the simplicity of linear search.
3. Requires minimal additional space.
4. Performs better than linear search for large arrays.

**Disadvantages:**
1. Requires the array to be sorted.
2. Not as efficient as binary search for arrays with irregular distribution.
3. May not be suitable for very small arrays where linear search may perform better.

**Applications:**
1. Searching in large sorted arrays.
2. Finding elements in databases or filesystems.
3. Where binary search is not feasible due to high overhead or complexity.
