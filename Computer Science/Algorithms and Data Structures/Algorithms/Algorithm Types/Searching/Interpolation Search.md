**Summary:**
Interpolation Search is an efficient searching algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array. Unlike binary search, which always divides the search space into two halves, interpolation search makes a more intelligent guess about the position of the target element by using the information about the distribution of elements in the array. It's particularly effective for large and uniformly distributed arrays.

**Algorithm:**

1. Calculate the position of the target element using interpolation formula:
   \[ pos = \text{low} + \frac{(x - \text{arr[low]}) \times (\text{high} - \text{low})}{\text{arr[high]} - \text{arr[low]}} \]
   Where:
   - `low` is the starting index of the array.
   - `high` is the ending index of the array.
   - `arr[]` is the sorted array.
   - `x` is the target element to be searched.

2. If the element at position `pos` is equal to `x`, return `pos`.
3. If the element at position `pos` is greater than `x`, search in the left sub-array `arr[low:pos-1]`.
4. If the element at position `pos` is less than `x`, search in the right sub-array `arr[pos+1:high]`.
5. Repeat the steps until the element is found or the sub-array becomes empty.

**Code (Java):**

```java
public class InterpolationSearch {
    public static int interpolationSearch(int[] arr, int x) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.length - 1;

        while (low <= high && x >= arr[low] && x <= arr[high]) {
            int pos = low + ((x - arr[low]) * (high - low)) / (arr[high] - arr[low]);

            if (arr[pos] == x)
                return pos;

            if (arr[pos] < x)
                low = pos + 1;
            else
                high = pos - 1;
        }
        return -1; // Element not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100};
        int x = 50;
        int index = interpolationSearch(arr, x);
        if (index != -1)
            System.out.println("Element found at index " + index);
        else
            System.out.println("Element not found");
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(log(log n)) on average, where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1).

**Advantages:**
1. Effective for large and uniformly distributed arrays.
2. Can outperform binary search in certain scenarios.
3. Provides a quicker search for elements closer to the beginning of the array.

**Disadvantages:**
1. Requires uniformly distributed data for optimal performance.
2. Doesn't work well with non-uniformly distributed data.
3. Requires sorted data.

**Applications:**
1. When the array is uniformly distributed.
2. Used in systems where time efficiency is crucial.
3. In scenarios where data is relatively static and doesn't change frequently.
