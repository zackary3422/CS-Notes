**Exponential Search**

**Summary:**
Exponential Search is a searching algorithm designed to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. It efficiently narrows down the search range by exponentially increasing the step size until finding a range where the target value is likely to exist. Exponential Search is best suited for scenarios where the size of the array is unknown or unbounded, and binary search may have high overhead.

**Algorithm:**

1. Determine the range \( [2^k, 2^{k+1}] \) where the target value might exist.
2. Perform a binary search within this range.
3. If the target value is not found, double the range size and repeat steps 1-2 until the target value is found or the end of the array is reached.

**Code (Java):**

```java
public class ExponentialSearch {
    public static int exponentialSearch(int[] arr, int x) {
        int n = arr.length;
        
        // If the element is present at the first position
        if (arr[0] == x)
            return 0;

        // Find the range where the target value might exist
        int i = 1;
        while (i < n && arr[i] <= x)
            i *= 2;

        // Perform binary search within the found range
        return binarySearch(arr, x, i / 2, Math.min(i, n - 1));
    }

    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int x, int low, int high) {
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == x)
                return mid;
            else if (arr[mid] < x)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }
        return -1; // Element not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
        int x = 6;
        int index = exponentialSearch(arr, x);
        if (index != -1)
            System.out.println("Element found at index " + index);
        else
            System.out.println("Element not found");
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1).

**Advantages:**
1. Efficient for unbounded or unknown array sizes.
2. Requires only one initial check to determine the search range.
3. Performs better than linear search for large arrays.
4. Guarantees logarithmic time complexity.

**Disadvantages:**
1. Requires the array to be sorted.
2. May not be as efficient as binary search for smaller arrays or arrays with regular sizes.
3. Not suitable for scenarios where the size of the array is known and fixed.

**Applications:**
1. Searching in unbounded arrays or datasets.
2. Database searches where the size of the dataset is unknown.
3. Where binary search may have high overhead or complexity.
