There are many different types of algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some of the most common types:

**1. Sorting Algorithms:**

Sorting algorithms order a list of elements according to a specific criteria. Some common sorting algorithms include:

- **[[Bubble Sort]]:** A simple but inefficient sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **[[Selection Sort]]:** Finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element.
- **[[Insertion Sort]]:** Builds a sorted list by inserting each element into its correct position.
- **[[Merge Sort]]:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively breaks down the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
- **[[Quick Sort]]:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the list around a pivot element and then sorts the sublists.

**2. Searching Algorithms:**

Searching algorithms find a specific element in a list or data structure. Some common searching algorithms include:

- **[[Linear Search]]:** Sequentially iterates through the list until it finds the target element.
- **[[Binary Search]]:** Recursively searches for the target element by dividing the list in half and then searching the appropriate sublist.
- **[[Hashing]]:** Uses a hash function to map the target element to a specific location in a hash table, allowing for constant-time access.

**3. Graph Algorithms:**

Graph algorithms process and analyze graphs, which are made up of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Some common graph algorithms include:

- **[[Depth-First Search]]:** Explores a graph by following a single path to its end before backtracking and exploring other paths.
- **[[Breadth-First Search]]:** Explores a graph by visiting all nodes at the same level before going to the next level.
- **[[Dijkstra's Algorithm]]:** Finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.
- **[[Bellman-Ford Algorithm]]:** Similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, but can handle negative-weight edges.

**4. [[Dynamic Programming]]:**

Dynamic programming solves complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to those subproblems to avoid recomputing them. This is useful for problems that have overlapping subproblems.

**5. [[Greedy Algorithms]]:**

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a globally optimal solution. This can be a powerful technique for some problems, but it is not guaranteed to always find the best solution.

**6. [[Backtracking]]:**

Backtracking is a technique for finding all possible solutions to a problem by systematically exploring all possible paths. This can be a useful technique for problems that have a limited number of possible solutions.

**7. [[Approximation Algorithms]]:**

Approximation algorithms provide solutions that are not necessarily optimal, but are guaranteed to be within a certain percentage of the optimal solution. This can be useful for problems that are too difficult to solve exactly.

**8. [[Heuristics]]:**

Heuristics are problem-specific strategies that are used to guide the search for a solution. They are not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, but they can be used to find good solutions quickly.

**9. [[Randomized Algorithms]]:**

Randomized algorithms use randomness to make decisions during the course of the algorithm. This can be used to improve the efficiency of some algorithms, but it can also make them less predictable.

**10. [[Parallel Algorithms]]:**

Parallel algorithms are designed to be executed on multiple processors or computers simultaneously. This can be used to significantly speed up the execution of some algorithms.
